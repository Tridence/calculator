# Complete The Calculator Assighnment

## Learning Goals

- Understand Event handling and Dom Manipulation.

## Introduction

In this assignment you will create a calculato using javascript. This lesson is
your third assignment!

All assignments are hosted on GitHub. In order to work on them, however, you
will need to complete work on your local machine.

User interface of the assignment is already done [here!](https://github.com/apprenticecloud/calculator)


- Download your personal copy (referred to as 'cloning') to your computer
- Navigate to  `js ` folder then  `main.js`
- Start working this folder 
- Complete the required work

In this assignment, you'll learn the workflow that you will use to deal with DOM manipulation and event handling. Every application that has a user interface and has observed separation of cocern basically requires javaScript to make the website lively

## Instruction to Completing Calculator Assignment


***The calculator fuctionality:***


- Next, we have to define the different operations that the calculator will perform. The first one is the `clear()` function, which will clear all the different variables. The next method is `delete()` for clearing a single number.

- We will also create a function that determines what will occur every time a user clicks on a number to add to the display called `appendNumber(number)`.

- We need a `chooseOperation(operation)` function that controls what will happen anytime a user clicks on any operation button.

- Another key function is `compute()`. It takes the values inside your calculator and displays the result.

- Finally, a `updateDisplay()` function lets us update the values inside of the output.


> **Note:** Use knowledge learned from prevous classes is highly required here.
